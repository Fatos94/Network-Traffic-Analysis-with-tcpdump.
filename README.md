# Network Traffic Analysis with tcpdump
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-ISC2_Member-00AA88?&style=for-the-badge&logo=ISC2&logoColor=white" />

## Project Description

This project involves capturing and analyzing network traffic using the `tcpdump` utility. The primary goal is to monitor packets on the network interface `eth0` and interpret the captured data. The results provide insights into the network activities, including communication between hosts and the types of protocols used.

### Task Description

The following command was executed to capture network traffic:

```sh
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c 5
```

sudo: Runs the command with superuser privileges.
tcpdump: The utility used for network packet capturing.
-i eth0: Specifies the network interface to capture traffic on (in this case, eth0).
-v: Enables verbose mode, providing detailed output.
-c 5: Captures 5 packets before exiting.
The initial command captured 5 packets, providing detailed information about each packet, including the protocol, source, destination, and additional flags and options.

Capturing HTTP Traffic
Additionally, the following commands were used to capture HTTP traffic on port 80 and save it to a file:

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c 9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &
curl opensource.google.com
ls -l capture.pcap

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c 9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &
curl opensource.google.com
ls -l capture.pcap
```

-nn: Disables name resolution for hostnames and ports.
-c 9: Captures 9 packets before exiting.
port 80: Filters for traffic on port 80 (HTTP).
-w capture.pcap: Writes the captured packets to a file named capture.pcap.
curl opensource.google.com: Generates HTTP traffic to capture.
ls -l capture.pcap: Lists the details of the captured file.
Analyzing Captured Traffic
To analyze the captured traffic in capture.pcap, the following commands were used:

```
sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v
sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X
```
-r capture.pcap: Reads packets from the file capture.pcap.
-v: Enables verbose mode, providing detailed output.
-X: Displays packet data in both hex and ASCII.


Results

Packet Analysis

Packet 1:
Timestamp: 08:08:13.930630
Protocol: TCP
Source: 1cfd7efcb63e.5000
Destination: nginx-us-west1-b.c.qwiklabs-terminal-vms-prod-00.internal.48394
Details: This packet includes TCP flags indicating it's a push acknowledgment ([P.]). The checksum is noted as incorrect but corrected in the display.
Length: 61 bytes of payload.


Packet 2:
Timestamp: 08:08:13.930901
Protocol: TCP
Source: nginx-us-west1-b.c.qwiklabs-terminal-vms-prod-00.internal.48394
Destination: 1cfd7efcb63e.5000
Details: This is an acknowledgment packet ([.]) with no payload.
Length: 0 bytes.


Packet 3:
Timestamp: 08:08:13.932199
Protocol: UDP
Source: 1cfd7efcb63e.41757
Destination: metadata.google.internal.domain
Details: This packet is a DNS query (PTR? 2.0.19.172.in-addr.arpa).
Length: 41 bytes.


Packet 4:
Timestamp: 08:08:13.939146
Protocol: UDP
Source: metadata.google.internal.domain
Destination: 1cfd7efcb63e.41757
Details: This packet is a DNS response to the previous query, resolving to nginx-us-west1-b.c.qwiklabs-terminal-vms-prod-00.internal.
Length: 112 bytes.


Packet 5:
Timestamp: 08:08:13.940780
Protocol: UDP
Source: 1cfd7efcb63e.56640
Destination: metadata.google.internal.domain
Details: This packet is another DNS query (PTR? 254.169.254.169.in-addr.arpa).
Length: 46 bytes.


Captured HTTP Traffic
The capture.pcap file contains 9 packets of HTTP traffic generated by the curl command to opensource.google.com. This file can be analyzed using tools like Wireshark for a more detailed inspection.

Using the additional analysis commands, we can read and display the captured traffic in detail. The -v option provides verbose output, while the -X option displays the packet data in both hexadecimal and ASCII formats, giving a clear view of the payload data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of tcpdump for capturing and analyzing network traffic, including specific HTTP traffic. By examining the captured packets, we can gain insights into the communication patterns and protocols used in the network. The detailed packet analysis highlights the importance of network monitoring for security and troubleshooting purposes.
